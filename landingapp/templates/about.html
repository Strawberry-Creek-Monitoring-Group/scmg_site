        <h1>Who We Are</h1>
        <p>The Strawberry Creek Monitoring Group was founded in 2024, as an off-branch of the Strawberry Creek Restoration Project, which began in 1987.</p>
        <p>We work to understand the ecology of Strawberry Creek through the use of Open-Source hardware and software!</p>
        <p>During 2024-2025, we will be funded by The Green Initiative Fund - afterwards, the Cal Environmental Initiative will support our mission of helping campuses learn and grow with their local watersheds.</p>

            <h3>ðŸŒ¿ Oil Sensor Development</h3>
            <p>In 2023, a significant Creek spill known as the Harvey Hall Diesel spill occurred, causing extensive damage. Much of this damage could have been prevented with proper detection systems.</p>
            <p>Currently, there is no creek oil detection system in place at Strawberry Creek, and existing commercial options are expensive.</p>
            <p>As a result, we are aiming to develop our own detection model, one that not only addresses these issues but can also be adapted and expanded to other schools facing similar challenges.</p>

            <h3>ðŸ’» Live Data Alerts</h3>
            <p>As part of our efforts to improve the monitoring of Strawberry Creek, we developed a live alerts and data information system.</p>
            <p>This system allows both faculty users and community members to easily access real-time data.</p>
