          <h1>Welcome to Strawberry Creek!</h1>
          <p>Strawberry Creek travels throughout the UC Berkeley Campus, and has been an integral part of our environment since the University's founding in 1868.</p>
          <p>Home to several endangered/threatened species and native wildlife, Strawberry Creek is an urban watershed that provides a living laboratory for learning about life. It also serves as an educational resource for several courses on campus.</p>
          <img src="image2.jpg" alt="Strawberry Creek scene">
          <h2>Who are we?</h2>
          <p>The Strawberry Creek Monitoring Group was founded in 2017, as an off-shoot of the Strawberry Creek Restoration Project, which began in 2004.</p>
          <p>We work to understand the ecology of Strawberry Creek through the use of Open-Source Hardware and software from 2004 - 2025, and will be featured by the Green Initiative Fund project in 2023 - 2025. Through this work, the Cal Creeks team program will continue our mission of helping campuses learn and grow with their local watersheds.</p>

          <h2>Our Work</h2>
          <h3>Oil Sensor Development</h3>
          <p>In 2019, a significant diesel spill known as the Stanley Hall Spill occurred, causing extensive damage. Much of this damage could have been prevented if the spill had been detected earlier. Currently, there is no reliable oil detection system in place at Strawberry Creek, and existing commercial solutions are prohibitively expensive. As a result, we are aiming to develop our own detection model, one that can address our specific needs but can also be adapted and exported to other schools facing similar challenges.</p>
          <h3>Live Data Alerts</h3>
          <p>As part of our efforts to improve the accessibility of spill data, we have implemented a live, web-and data-information system. This system allows both faculty, staff, and community members to easily access real-time spill data. Try out our web app (here: [link]), to stay updated on creek conditions, and us for alerts here!</p>
          <h3>Community Outreach</h3>
          <p>-Integrate creek sensors and data into CEE coursework to foster interdisciplinary learning</p>
          <p>-Host demonstration days on and off campus to showcase sensor deployment and alarm setup, tracking participant feedback.</p>
