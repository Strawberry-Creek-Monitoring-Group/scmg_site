                Strawberry Creek travels throughout the UC Berkeley Campus, and has been an integral part
                of our environment since the University's founding in 1868. Home to several endangered/
                threatened species and native wildlife, Strawberry Creek is an urban watershed teeming with
                life. It also serves as an educational resource for several courses on campus.
